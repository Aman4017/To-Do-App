# To-Do App

## About
Through this project, I aim to assess and exhibit my proficiency in Create, Read and Delete principles by utilizing local storage and vanilla JavaScript. Users are able to organize their duties into multiple to-do lists using the To-Do List Web App. This app allows you to create multiple to-do lists, and corresponding to each list, you can add multiple tasks.
